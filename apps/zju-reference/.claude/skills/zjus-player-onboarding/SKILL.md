# ZJUS Player Onboarding

## Overview

This project's onboarding flow crosses HTTP, localStorage, Redis, Postgres saves, and WebSocket auth. Keep the contracts explicit and test both new-user and returning-user paths.

## Current Flow

1. `POST /api/auth` validates username, invite code, blacklist/restrictions, and optional persistent user token.
2. New users receive a JWT plus a persistent `user_token`, then go to character creation.
3. Returning users receive a JWT plus save summaries, then choose an existing save or start a new game.
4. `POST /api/init_character` validates JWT, major, and the stat-registry initial budget, then writes a fresh Redis state.
5. The game WebSocket expects JWT auth in the first message. Loading an old save uses `load_save_slot`.

## Token Rules

- Treat `zju_jwt` and `zju_token` as JWT-compatible auth for current sessions.
- Store the long-lived player credential separately as `zju_user_token`.
- Never send `zju_user_token` to the WebSocket as the auth token.
- On logout, expired JWT, or invalid WebSocket auth, clear game-start/save-selection localStorage enough to avoid refresh loops.

## Stat Rules

- Allocatable stats come from `zjus-backend/world/stat_definitions.json`; currently IQ/EQ/Luck/Charm must each be in `50..150`.
- Their sum must equal the registry `initial_budget`, currently `300`.
- Prefer the `stats` map on `POST /api/init_character`; legacy `iq`/`eq`/`luck`/`charm` fields remain compatible.
- Preserve the major IQ bonus after validation; do not count the major bonus against the 300-point user budget unless the user explicitly asks to change the design.
- Enforce the budget server-side in `zjus-backend/app/api/auth.py`, not only in `CharacterCreate.vue`.
- After changing allocatable stats, run `scripts/sync_stat_definitions.py --write`, `scripts/validate_world_data.py`, regenerate OpenAPI via Docker Compose, and update focused tests.

## Save Rules

- Returning users should not be forced into `CharacterCreate`.
- Loading an existing save should explicitly pass the selected slot and force DB-to-Redis loading.
- Starting a new game should clear/reset current Redis game data before initializing a fresh character.
- Preserve `save_slot` semantics even if the UI currently exposes only one slot; the table and service are slot-aware.

## Validation Checklist

Run focused tests for backend validation, then type-check frontend:

```powershell
..\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest
.\node_modules\.bin\vue-tsc.cmd --noEmit
```

For end-to-end API verification, use the compose backend, not a local uvicorn process.
