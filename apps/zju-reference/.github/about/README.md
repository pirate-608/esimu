# About `.github/` of ZJUers Simulator Project

This directory contains GitHub-specific configuration for this repository.

## Contents

### For GitHub Copilot

| File / Directory | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `copilot-instructions.md` | Main instruction file for Copilot Chat. Automatically included in all Copilot requests. |
| `instructions/*.instructions.md` | Path‑specific instructions. Use `applyTo` glob pattern to target certain files or directories. |
| `prompts/*.prompt.md` | Reusable prompt templates. Reference them manually with `#` in Copilot Chat. |
| `skills/*/SKILL.md` | Agent skills for Copilot. Place each skill in its own subdirectory. |

> **Note:** Copilot also reads `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` if placed at the repository root, but does **not** read `.agents/` or `.claude/` subdirectories automatically.
> You can also migrate skills from `.codex/`,`.agents/` or `.claude/` to this folder.

- `workflows/` – CI/CD pipeline definitions
- `workflows/deploy_docs.yml` - Auto build and deploy the VitePress documentation site in `docs/`

## For contributors

- Keep `copilot-instructions.md` concise and project‑wide.
- Use `instructions/` for rules that apply only to specific paths (e.g., backend vs frontend).
- Name instruction files clearly: `python.instructions.md`, `frontend.instructions.md`, etc.
- Each skill in `skills/` should have a `SKILL.md` with frontmatter (`name`, `description`) and clear steps.
