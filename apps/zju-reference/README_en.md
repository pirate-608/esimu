## What is this?

This is "ZJUers Simulator," a game dedicated to building a parallel universe of Zhejiang University. We use large language models to provide content support for the game and maintain a comprehensive set of world-building files as the game's foundational setting.

## Co-create the World
If you think this game is decent but still feels like something is missing, it's because the world-building files we maintain are still in their early stages.
The structure of our world-building files is as follows:

```
zjus-backend/world/
├── courses/
│   └── ... (40 course JSON files in total, e.g., CS.json, AI.json)
├── achievements.json  # Achievement system
├── characters.json    # Character system
├── game_balance.json  # Game balance
├── graduation_comments.json # Graduation fallback comments
├── items.json         # Item system
├── keywords.json      # Keywords
├── majors.json        # Major system
├── stat_definitions.json # Stat definitions
├── notice.md          # Announcements
└── rules.html         # Game rules
```

The files within the `courses` folder constitute the course system (data source: [Undergraduate Academic Management Information Service Platform](https://zdbk.zju.edu.cn)). These files, along with `achievements.json`, `characters.json`, `majors.json`, `game_balance.json`, `graduation_comments.json`, `items.json`, `stat_definitions.json`, `keywords.json`, and others, are loaded directly by the backend.

The world-building files and the LLM together form the soul of this game. Using the LLM requires a paid API, but the contents of the `world/` folder are priceless. Its growth depends on every alumnus dedicated to building the world of the ZJUers Simulator.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the source code
git clone https://github.com/pirate-608/ZJUers_simulator.git
cd ZJUers_simulator
# Configure environment variables
cp .env.template .env
```
Environment variable template
```bash
SECRET_KEY=your_random_string
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://zju:your_database_password@db:5432/zjus
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_database_password
ADMIN_USERNAME=your_admin_username
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_admin_password
ADMIN_SESSION_SECRET=your_admin_session_secret
INVITE_CODES=local_test_invite_code_1,local_test_invite_code_2
LLM_API_KEY=your_llm_api_key (optional)
LLM_BASE_URL=https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1
LLM=your_model_name
MINIMAX_API_KEY=your_minimax_api_key (optional, leave empty to fall back to default LLM)
MINIMAX_MODEL=M2-her
MINIMAX_BASE_URL=https://api.minimaxi.com/v1
```

```bash
# Copy the Docker Compose local override template
cp docker-compose.override.example docker-compose.override.yml

# Build and start
docker compose up -d --build

# Visit http://localhost to start playing
```

## Documentation Site Development

The documentation site lives in `docs/` and is built with VitePress. Theme files, Vue components, and static assets are isolated inside that directory.

```bash
cd zjus-frontend
npm install

cd ../docs
npm install
npm run dev
npm run build
```

The documentation homepage uses an atmospheric starfield theme with an embedded interactive Vue demo. The demo reuses components from `zjus-frontend`, so a clean environment should install frontend dependencies before building the docs. Static image paths remain available at `/assets/images/*` for README and external links.
